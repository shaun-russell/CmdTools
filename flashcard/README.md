# FLASHCARD
A command-line/terminal application for testing things. Basically presents some text and requires some text as an answer.

## Installation
Download the files and install locally with pip. Requires Python 3 and the `click` package (this should be installed automatically because it's a required package).

`pip install .`

You can also just copy and paste the files around, but that's not a very good approach.
Once installed, run just `flashcard` or `flashcard --help` in the terminal for usage instructions.

## Usage
blah

## Notes
Sample data files are not included because the license does not allow it.

DateTime formats are strings in `YYYY-mm-dd HH:MM` 24-hour format.
