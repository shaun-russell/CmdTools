# CmdTools
I seem to be writing the same tools from scratch over and over again, so it would be a good idea to just make one good version of each tool with a proper interface and non-hacky features.

Open one of the folders to view the individual programs.

# Completed/Working Programs
## FileFilter (filefilter)

This program filters lines in a file based on the values in one of the columns. These values can be provided in a file or as a comma-separated string.

## SSIMby  (ssimby)
_Pronounced_ sim-bee, this program parses and extracts flights out of big (>1GB) IATA ssim files. Can merge information from airport files and creates flight dates for arrival and departure in both local and UTC time for each operating day of a flight within a given date range to and/or from specified airports.

# WIP Programs
Currently, none.
